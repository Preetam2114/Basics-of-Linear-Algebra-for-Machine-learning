Thankfully, NumPy provides a built-in workaround to allow arithmetic between arrays with differing sizes."

    "Broadcasting is the name given to the method that NumPy uses to allow array arithmetic between arrays with a different shape or size. Although the technique was developed for NumPy, it has also been adopted more broadly in other numerical computational libraries, such as Theano, TensorFlow, and Octave Broadcasting solves the problem of arithmetic between arrays of differing shapes by in effect replicating the smaller array along the last mismatched dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy does not actually duplicate the smaller array, instead, it makes memory and computationally effcient use of existing structures in memory that in effect achieve the same result. The concept has also permeated linear algebra notation to simplify the explanation of simple operations.\n",
