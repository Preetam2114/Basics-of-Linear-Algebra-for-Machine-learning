    "# Singular Value Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix decomposition, also known as matrix factorization, involves describing a given matrix using its constituent elements. Perhaps the most known and widely used matrix decomposition method is the Singular-Value Decomposition, or SVD. All matrices have an SVD, which makes it more stable than other methods, such as the eigendecomposition. As such, it is often used in a wide array of applications including compressing, denoising, and data reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is the Singular-Value Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "The Singular-Value Decomposition, or SVD for short, is a matrix decomposition method for reducing a matrix to its constituent parts in order to make certain subsequent matrix calculations simpler. For the case of simplicity we will focus on the SVD for real-valued matrices and ignore the case for complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = U\\cdot \\Sigma \\cdot V^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where A is the real n x m matrix that we wish to decompose, U is an m x m matrix, $\\Sigma$ represented by the uppercase Greek letter sigma) is an m x n diagonal matrix, and $V^T$ is the V transpose of an n x n matrix where T is a superscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagonal values in the $\\Sigma$ matrix are known as the singular values of the original matrix A. The columns of the U matrix are called the left-singular vectors of A, and the columns of V are called the right-singular vectors of A. The SVD is calculated via iterative numerical methods. We will not go into the details of these methods. Every rectangular matrix has a singular value decomposition, although the resulting matrices may contain complex numbers and the limitations of floating point arithmetic may cause some matrices to fail to decompose neatly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVD is used widely both in the calculation of other matrix operations, such as matrix inverse, but also as a data reduction method in machine learning. SVD can also be used in least squares linear regression, image compression, and denoising data."

The $\\Sigma$ diagonal matrix is returned as a vector of singular values. The V matrix is returned in a transposed form, e.g. $V^T$ . The example below defines a 3 x 2 matrix and calculates the singular-value decomposition."

    "The original matrix can be reconstructed from the U, $\\Sigma$, and $V^T$ elements. The U, s, and V elements returned from the **svd()** cannot be multiplied directly. The s vector must be converted into a diagonal matrix using the **diag()** function. By default, this function will create a square matrix that is m x m, relative to our original matrix. This causes a problem as the size of the matrices do not fit the rules of matrix multiplication, where the number of columns in a matrix must match the number of rows in the subsequent matrix. After creating the square $\\Sigma$ diagonal matrix, the sizes of the matrices are relative to the original n x m matrix that we are decomposing, as follows:\n",
