    "# Matrix Decompositions\n",
    "\n",
    "Many complex matrix operations cannot be solved efficiently or with stability using the limited precision of computers. Matrix decompositions are methods that reduce a matrix into constituent parts that make it easier to calculate more complex matrix operations. Matrix decomposition methods, also called matrix factorization methods, are a foundation of linear algebra in computers, even for basic operations such as solving systems of linear equations, calculating the inverse, and calculating the determinant of a matrix.\n",

    "## What is a Matrix Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix decomposition is a way of reducing a matrix into its constituent parts. It is an approach that can simplify more complex matrix operations that can be performed on the decomposed matrix rather than on the original matrix itself. A common analogy for matrix decomposition is the factoring of numbers, such as the factoring of 10 into 2 x 5. For this reason, matrix decomposition is also called matrix factorization. Like factoring real values, there are many ways to decompose a matrix, hence there are a range of different matrix decomposition techniques. Two simple and widely used matrix decomposition methods are the LU matrix decomposition and the QR matrix decomposition. Next, we will take a closer look at each of these methods."

    "## LU Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "The LU decomposition is for square matrices and decomposes a matrix into L and U components.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = L\\cdot U$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where A is the square matrix that we wish to decompose, L is the lower triangle matrix and U is the upper triangle matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LU decomposition is found using an iterative numerical process and can fail for those matrices that cannot be decomposed or decomposed easily. A variation of this decomposition that is numerically more stable to solve in practice is called the LUP decomposition, or the LU decomposition with partial pivoting.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = L\\cdot U\\cdot P$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rows of the parent matrix are re-ordered to simplify the decomposition process and the additional P matrix specifies a way to permute the result or return the result to the original order. There are also other variations of the LU. The LU decomposition is often used to simplify the solving of systems of linear equations, such as finding the coefficients in a linear regression, as well as in calculating the determinant and inverse of a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LU decomposition can be implemented in Python with the **lu()** function. More specifically, this function calculates an LPU decomposition. The example below first defines a 3 x 3 square matrix. The LU decomposition is calculated, then the original matrix is reconstructed from the components."

The example below defines a 3 x 2 matrix, calculates the QR decomposition, then reconstructs the original matrix from the decomposed elements."
