    "The rank of a matrix is the estimate of the number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix. The rank of a matrix M is often denoted as the function **rank()**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An intuition for rank is to consider it the number of dimensions spanned by all of the vectors within a matrix. For example, a rank of 0 suggest all vectors span a point, a rank of 1 suggests all vectors span a line, a rank of 2 suggests all vectors span a two-dimensional plane. The rank is estimated numerically, often using a matrix decomposition method. A common approach is to use the Singular-Value Decomposition or SVD for short. NumPy provides the matrix rank() function for calculating the rank of an array. It uses the SVD method to estimate the rank. The example below demonstrates calculating the rank of a matrix with scalar values and another vector with all zero values."
