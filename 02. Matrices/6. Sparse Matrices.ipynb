Large sparse matrices are common in general and especially in applied machine learning, such as in data that contains counts, data encodings that map categories to counts, and even in whole sub fields of machine learning such as natural language processing. It is computationally expensive to represent and work with sparse matrices as though they are dense, and much improvement in performance can be achieved by using\n",

    "## Problems with Sparsity\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse matrices can cause problems with regards to space and time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Very large matrices require a lot of memory, and some very large matrices that we wish to work\n",
    "with are sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: In practice, most large matrices are sparse - almost all entries are zeros.**\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a very large matrix that is too large to be stored in memory is a link matrix that shows the links from one website to another. An example of a smaller sparse matrix might be a word or term occurrence matrix for words in one book against all known words in English. In both cases, the matrix contained is sparse with many more zero values than data values. The problem with representing these sparse matrices as dense matrices is that memory is required and must be allocated for each 32-bit or even 64-bit zero value in the matrix. This is clearly a waste of memory resources as those zero values do not contain any information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a very large sparse matrix can be fit into memory, we will want to perform operations on this matrix. Simply, if the matrix contains mostly zero-values, i.e. no data, then performing operations across this matrix may take a long time where the bulk of the computation performed will involve adding or multiplying zero values together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: It is wasteful to use general methods of linear algebra on such problems, because\n",
    "most of the $O(N^3)$ arithmetic operations devoted to solving the set of equations or\n",
    "inverting the matrix involve zero operands.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem of increased time complexity of matrix operations that increases with the size of the matrix. This problem is compounded when we consider that even trivial machine learning methods may require many operations on each row, column, or even across the entire matrix, resulting in vastly longer execution times.\n"

    "Sparse matrices turn up a lot in applied machine learning. In this section, we will look at some common examples to motivate you to be aware of the issues of sparsity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse matrices come up in some specific types of data, most notably observations that record the occurrence or count of an activity. Three examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether or not a user has watched a movie in a movie catalog.\n",
    "- Whether or not a user has purchased a product in a product catalog.\n",

    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse matrices come up in encoding schemes used in the preparation of data. Three common examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One hot encoding, used to represent categorical data as sparse binary vectors.\n",
    "- Count encoding, used to represent the frequency of words in a vocabulary for a document\n",
    "- TF-IDF encoding, used to represent normalized word frequency scores in a vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Areas of Study\n",
    "\n",
    "Some areas of study within machine learning must develop specialized methods to address sparsity directly as the input data is almost always sparse. Three examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Natural language processing for working with documents of text.\n",
    "- Recommender systems for working with product usage within a catalog.\n",
    "- Computer vision when working with images that contain lots of black pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: If there are 100,000 words in the language model, then the feature vector has length 100,000, but for a short email message almost all the features will have count zero.**"

    "The solution to representing and working with sparse matrices is to use an alternate data structure to represent the sparse data.

There are multiple data structures that can be used to efficiently construct a sparse matrix; three common examples are listed below.\n",

    "- **Dictionary of Keys** A dictionary is used where a row and column index is mapped to a value.\n",
